## Some Educational Background

I studied Environmental Engineering at Kocaeli University and graduated in 2019. Migrated to the UK shortly after graduation. Since then, I've been bouncing between marketing, social media, and hospitality jobs before deciding to study Data Science. Currently, I'm a mature MSc student at Birkbeck whilst working and living my life along the way.

## What Makes Me Different?

I still can't answer this question fully, because the things I do and believe aren't different to me, they're just my core values. But here's what I've worked out so far:

I've got a passion for environmental science, which led me to study my undergrad. After finishing as an Environmental Engineer, I decided to change countries that's how I ended up in the UK. The endless question for me is: what will still drive me +50 years from now?

I worked as part of the marketing team as a social media executive, content creator, SEO analyst, pretty much every role going. But I always loved working with numbers, analysing audience characteristics and trying to make meaningful predictions. That's what led me to Data Science to learn the solid foundations behind what I was already doing.

The flexibility of data science is that if numbers or any sort of data are involved in a subject, as a data scientist, it gives you work with anything (sky's the limit, I reckon). Here's where I think I'm different: I can actually understand the environmental problems and A/B testing scenarios I'm working with. The data isn't just numbers for me. My experiences, undergrad background, and passion let me see what's behind those numbers. I can explain why those great pipeline models will work and how to improve them and when  is the time to improve.

## What I'm Learning

Since knowledge is infinite, there are always learning opportunities:

**Programming Languages:** Python, SQL, R  
**Data Science Stack:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, NLTK  
**Machine Learning:** Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks, Time Series Forecasting, Bayesian Statistics  
**Other Tools:** Tableau, QlikView, Git, Jupyter, Google Analytics, Hootsuite

## What Type of Analysis Do I Love Doing?

Environmental data analysis, air quality modelling, climate data wrangling, psychological coping and behaviour modelling analysis

## Projects I've Built (and Ones Still in Progress)

### London Air Quality Prediction

My MSc dissertation project: Predicting air pollution levels across London using machine learning. I'm pulling data from the London Air Quality Network, TfL traffic data, and weather APIs to build models that can forecast NO2 and PM2.5 levels.

Still developing it, but so far I've got data cleaning sorted, feature engineering done, and I'm working through Random Forest and SVM implementations. The goal is to create something that actually helps people understand when and where air quality will be problematic.

**Tech:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, real-time APIs

### YouTube Audio Analysis Pipeline

Built an automated system to download audio from YouTube videos and analyse the metadata. The interesting bit was comparing serial vs parallel processing - managed to get 4x speed improvement with multiprocessing.

Downloaded 11 tracks (please don't judge my music taste!), processed all the metadata, and built visualisations showing everything from view counts to duration patterns. The project showed me how much faster you can make things with proper parallel processing.

**Tech:** Python, yt-dlp, multiprocessing, matplotlib

### Weather API Analysis Project
**[github.com/Burcucgln/weather-api-analysis-toolkit](https://github.com/Burcucgln/weather-api-analysis-toolkit)**

One of the first projects where I got organised code and test code in different Python files and had them fetch from each other.

Created a toolkit that pulls real-time weather data from 30 cities worldwide and analyses patterns. Built custom functions to find the hottest/coldest cities, temperature ranges and biggest daily temperature swings.

All done without using built-in Python functions like len() or sum(), old-school programming to really understand what's happening under the hood.

**Tech:** Python, Open-Meteo API, statistical analysis

### Political Speech Classification
**[github.com/Burcucgln/nlp-text-classification-suite](https://github.com/Burcucgln/nlp-text-classification-suite)**

NLP project classifying political speeches by party affiliation. Built the whole pipeline from text preprocessing to model evaluation, comparing different algorithms and vectorisation approaches.

Used Hansard data to train models that can predict which party a speech came from. Interesting challenge in text processing and feature engineering.

**Tech:** Python, NLTK, spaCy, Scikit-learn

Looking for opportunities where I can apply data science to make a real difference in environmental challenges. Happy to chat about opportunities along the way.

Currently balancing full-time study, full-time work, and trying to convince myself that bouldering and swimming count as networking.
